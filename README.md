# INFO

This is a copy of [`hmatrix`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix-0.20.0.0 "hackage") where
simply all Double have been converted to Float and the instances that appeared twice (as Float
instances already existed in the original `hmatrix`) have been commented out.


# WARNING

There is no guarantee that the operations have been correctly converted!
